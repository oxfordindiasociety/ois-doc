## Michaelmas 2014

Oxford India Society participated in the Fresher’s Fair organized by the Oxford University (8-10 October 2014). 

To welcome the Fresher’s and celebrate the start of term, Oxford India Society organized a Meet and Greet at the Green Templeton College Bar, Wednesday 15 October, 8- 11 pm which saw a huge turnout of over 100 new students.

Oxford India Society in collaboration with South Asian Studies hosted a film screening of **Birth 1871: History, The State and The Arts of Denotified Tribes of India** followed by a Question and Answer session with the director of the documentary **Dakxinkumar Bajrange** at Saskatchewan Room, Exeter College, 5.30pm-8:00 pm. Produced by Nomad Movies and the University of Leeds, the film combined historical research with documentary-style filming to raise questions about the citizenship status of Nomadic and Denotified Tribes in contemporary India. The film unearthed experiences of enforced state rehabilitation, 'settlement', and community assertion in two transitional periods of 1946-1953 and 1978-2000s. It explored the processes of 'criminalization' and discussed how DNTs (Denotified Tribes) talk about their status as ‘Second Class Citizens’ of India still lacking constitutional guarantees from India’s state and federal governments. The film brought out the use of theatrical arts by the community to combat social stigma and bring about community development.
